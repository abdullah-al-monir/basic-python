# In Python, a while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. When the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.

cnt = 0
while cnt < 3:
    print("Hello Python")
    cnt = cnt + 1

# infinite loop
# while(True):
#     print("Hello Python")
