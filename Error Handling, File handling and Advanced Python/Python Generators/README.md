# Python Generators âœ¨

**Generators** are functions that act as **iterators** but are defined using the `yield` keyword instead of `return`. They are essential for memory-efficient and lazy evaluation, especially when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.

## Key Concepts

* **`yield` vs `return`**: `yield` pauses execution and saves the function's state; `return` terminates the function.
* **Lazy Evaluation**: Values are computed and produced only when requested by `next()`.
* **Syntax**: Defined either as a generator function (`def` with `yield`) or a generator expression (`(...)`).
