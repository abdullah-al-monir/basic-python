# Python File Handling üìÅ

File handling is the crucial process of managing data interaction between a Python program and the file system. It ensures persistent data storage and access to external data sources.

## Core Operations

| File | Operation | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `opening_and_closing.py` | Basic Setup | Demonstrates the `open()` function, file modes, and the manual `close()` method. |
| `reading_files.py` | Read Operations | Examples of using `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()` to consume file data. |
| `writing_and_appending.py` | Write Operations | Shows how to write (`w`) to a file (overwriting) and append (`a`) to it. |
| `using_with_statement.py` | Context Manager | The preferred, safer way to handle files, ensuring automatic resource cleanup. |
| `exception_handling.py` | Error Prevention | Ensures files are closed even if an exception occurs during processing. |
