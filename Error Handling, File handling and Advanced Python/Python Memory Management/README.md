# Python Memory Management ðŸ§ 

Python automates memory management using two primary mechanisms: **Reference Counting** and **Garbage Collection**. This process ensures efficient memory usage without manual intervention from the programmer.

## Core Topics

| File | Topic | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `reference_counting.py` | Reference Counting | Demonstrates how Python tracks object references to manage memory allocation and deallocation. |
| `garbage_collection.py` | Garbage Collection | Explains Python's secondary cleanup mechanism for circular references. |
| `memory_optimization.py` | Object Interning | Shows Python's internal optimization for small, immutable objects like small integers. |
| `stack_and_heap.py` | Memory Areas | Differentiates between Stack (function calls/references) and Heap (object data) memory. |
