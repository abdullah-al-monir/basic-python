# Python Exception Handling üõ°Ô∏è

Exception handling is a mechanism that allows Python programs to gracefully manage unexpected events and errors that occur during runtime, preventing the program from crashing.

## Key Concepts

* **Error vs. Exception:** **Errors** (like `SyntaxError`) are serious problems that typically stop execution immediately. **Exceptions** (like `ZeroDivisionError`) occur at runtime and *can* be caught and handled.
* **Keywords:** The four main keywords are `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally`.
* **Custom Exceptions:** Developers can create application-specific exceptions for clarity and precise error management.
