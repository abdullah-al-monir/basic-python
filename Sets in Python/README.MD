# Python Sets ðŸŒŒ

A **Set** is an **unordered** collection of **unique** (no duplicates) elements. They are **mutable**, meaning elements can be added or removed after creation, but the individual elements themselves must be **immutable** types (like numbers, strings, or tuples).

Sets are optimized for membership testing, eliminating duplicates, and performing mathematical set operations like union and intersection.
