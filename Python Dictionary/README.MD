# Python Dictionaries

This collection of files explores the Python dictionary, a versatile data structure that stores data in key: value pairs. Dictionaries are highly efficient for searching, inserting, and deleting items due to their use of hashing.

## File Descriptions

### dict_creation.py

This file demonstrates the fundamental ways to create dictionaries, including using curly braces ({}) and the dict() constructor.

### dict_access_and_modify.py

Learn how to retrieve and update values in a dictionary using both square bracket notation ([]) and the safe .get() method. It also shows how to add new key-value pairs.

### dict_removal.py

This file covers the different methods for removing items from a dictionary, such as the del statement, .pop(), .popitem(), and .clear().

### dict_iteration.py

Discover the various ways to loop through a dictionary to access its keys, values, or both simultaneously using methods like .keys(), .values(), and .items().

### nested_dictionaries.py

This file focuses on using dictionaries within other dictionaries to represent complex, structured data. It shows how to create, access, modify, and delete elements in these multi-level data structures.
