# Python Lists

This collection of files provides a hands-on guide to Python lists, a versatile and fundamental data structure. Unlike simple arrays, Python lists are dynamic, ordered, and can store a variety of data types, making them incredibly flexible for many programming tasks.

## File Descriptions

### creating_lists.py

This file demonstrates the various ways to create lists, including using square brackets ([]), the list() constructor, and the multiplication operator to create lists with repeated items.

### accessing_and_modifying.py

Learn how to access, slice, and modify elements within a list using both positive and negative indexing.

### adding_and_removing.py

This file covers essential methods for manipulating a list's size, including append(), insert(), extend(), remove(), pop(), and the del statement.

### iteration_and_nested.py

Discover how to efficiently loop through list elements using a for loop and how to work with nested lists (lists within lists), which are useful for representing data like matrices or grids.

### list_comprehension.py

Explore the concise and powerful syntax of list comprehension, which allows you to create new lists from existing ones in a single, readable line of code.

### list_storage.py

This file delves into how Python lists work under the hood, explaining that they store references (pointers) to objects in memory rather than the objects themselves. This is a key concept for understanding mutability.
