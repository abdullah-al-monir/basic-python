# Python Strings

This folder contains several Python files that demonstrate fundamental concepts and operations for working with strings. A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text data in Python.

### File Descriptions
This section provides a brief overview of each Python file and the string concepts it covers.

### creating_strings.py

This file shows how to create strings using single quotes, double quotes, and triple quotes for multi-line strings.

### accessing_and_slicing.py

Learn how to retrieve individual characters and substrings from a string using both positive and negative indexing. It also demonstrates how to reverse a string using a slicing shortcut.

### string_properties.py

This file explores key properties of Python strings, including their immutability. It provides examples of how to "update" a string by creating a new one, and how to perform common operations like concatenation and repetition.

### string_methods.py

Discover several useful built-in string methods such as len(), upper(), lower(), strip(), and replace().

### string_formatting_membership.py

This file covers two essential topics:

1.  String Formatting: Learn to embed variables and expressions into strings using modern f-strings and the traditional .format() method.

2.  Membership Testing: Use the in keyword to check if a specific substring exists within a string.
